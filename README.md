# StitchedNeRF_2
This is a project that has taken multiple NeRF models, exported them into Unreal Engine 5, and stitched the NeRF models together such that it creates one giant NeRF model the player can fly through and explore.

To run the project, you have to download the Volinga plugin from volinga.ai. This also needs to be enabled from the plugin settings in Unreal engine. Then you can clone the repository into you Unreal Engine saves.
